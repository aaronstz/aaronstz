<h3><mark>Pokemon App</mark></h3>

![pokemonHome](https://ucarecdn.com/76c32236-8734-4054-b11c-a5abda8d5fdf/)
A page that allows to search for pokemons info, brought through <a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2">Pokemon API</a>, you can sort them alphabetically, by strength, type and if they come from the api or if they were created.
You can create your own Pokemon, with it's own name, strength, defense, attack, image, etc. and if you want more information of him, you can access it's details.
Everything was done with pure CSS without css frameworks or any external components.
